Python Evolutionary Algorithms
==============================

This is a library of evolutionary algorithms with a focus on _neuroevolution_, implemented in pure python, depending on numpy. It contains a faithful implementation of [Ken Stanley][1]'s **NEAT** (Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies) and HyperNEAT. The focus of this library is **easy experimentation**, it is pure python so it's easy to set up, and it has a simple and flexible API.

This code was written to do the experiments for:

- the paper [Critical Factors in the Performance of HyperNEAT](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/s.a.whiteson/pubs/vandenberggecco13.pdf)
- and the more extensive thesis [An Empirical Analysis of HyperNEAT](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/s.a.whiteson/tvdb-thesis.pdf)
